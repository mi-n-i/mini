      The area around the tower was remodeled as a European-style park and
      opened to the public in March 1995. It features a waterfall, fountains,
      lighting displays, and flowers, as well as rides, exhibition and
      performance halls, and restaurants. E-World has several plazas
      characterized by different themes; major plazas include Entry Plaza,
      Central Plaza, Children’s Plaza (playground), and Young Town Plaza.
