      It is the third-largest urban agglomeration in South Korea after Seoul and
      Busan; it is the third-largest official metropolitan area in the nation
      with over 2.5 million residents; and the second-largest city after Busan
      in the Yeongnam region in southeastern Korean Peninsula. It was overtaken
      by Incheon in the 2000s, but still it is said to be the third city,
      according to the "Act on the Establishment of Daegu City and Incheon City"
      (Act No. 3424 and April 13, 1981). Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang
      Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population
      over 5 million.
